Original open AI code is covered under that license.

We modified that code using tensorflow 2 conversion util.

The hparams file is licensed under apache via the tensor2tensor authors.

If there is any additional IP created by the conversion of the open AI src it would probably fall under apache but if not is hereby released into the public domain.
